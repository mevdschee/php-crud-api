## Installation

```bash
composer require nyholm/psr7
```

If you are using Symfony Flex then you get all message factories registered as services. 

## Usage

The PSR-7 objects do not contain any other public methods then those defined in
the [PSR-7 specification](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/). 

### Create objects

Use the PSR-17 factory to create requests, streams, URIs etc.  

```php
$factory = new \Nyholm\Psr7\Factory\Psr17Factory();
$request = $factory->createRequest('GET', 'http://tnyholm.se');
$stream = $factory->createStream('foobar');
```

### Sending a request

With [HTTPlug](http://httplug.io/) or any other PSR-18 (HTTP client) you may send 
requests like: 

```bash
composer require kriswallsmith/buzz
```

```php
$psr17Factory = new \Nyholm\Psr7\Factory\Psr17Factory();
$psr18Client = new Buzz\Client\Curl($psr17Factory);

$request = (new Psr17Factory())->createRequest('GET', 'http://tnyholm.se');
$response = $psr18Client->sendRequest($request);
```

### Create server requests

The [`nyholm/psr7-server`](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7-server) package can be used 
to create server requests from PHP superglobals.

```bash
composer require nyholm/psr7-server
```

```php
use Nyholm\Psr7\Factory\Psr17Factory;

$psr17Factory = new Psr17Factory();

$creator = new ServerRequestCreator(
    $psr17Factory, // ServerRequestFactory
    $psr17Factory, // UriFactory
    $psr17Factory, // UploadedFileFactory
    $psr17Factory  // StreamFactory
);

$serverRequest = $creator->fromGlobals();
```

### Emitting a response

```bash
composer require zendframework/zend-httphandlerrunner
```

```php
$response = (new Psr17Factory())->createReponse('200', 'Hello world');
(new \Zend\HttpHandlerRunner\Emitter\SapiEmitter())->emit($response);
```

## Our goal

This package is currently maintained by [Tobias Nyholm](http://nyholm.se) and 
[Martijn van der Ven](https://vanderven.se/martijn/). They have decided that the
goal of this library should be to provide a super strict implementation of 
[PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) that is blazing fast. 

The package will never include any extra features nor helper methods. All our classes
and functions exist because they are required to fulfill the PSR-7 specification.
